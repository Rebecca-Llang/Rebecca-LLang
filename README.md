## My name is Rebecca Lang ðŸ‘‹ she/her
âœ¨ Don't be misled by the extra 'L' in my GitHub handle! âœ¨

## About Me
I am a software developer and graduate of Dev Academy, based in Aotearoa. I have a passion for accessibility, collaboration and the power of technology to improve our collective quality of life. 

## Projects & Skills

- ðŸ–¥ I'm currently working on building my portfolio, my [karaoke playlist app](https://github.com/Rebecca-Llang/my-karaoke-playlist), and the budding OK! Karaoke app which explores further features. 

- ðŸ’š DonateMate: This app was built over 7 days for our final group project at Dev Academy. As product owner and contributor, I led the design, planning and execution. DonateMate allows donors to find the organisations that are most in need of their donation type, and allowed organisations to create profiles to manage and communicate their donation needs. I focused on implementing Auth0, the organisation profiles, filtering organisations by donation type, and improving UI accessibility and experience. Check it out live [here](https://donatemate.pushed.nz) or the repo [here](https://github.com/Rebecca-Llang/donate-mate)!

- ðŸŒ± I'm building my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, RESTful APIs, Vitest, Superagent, Express, Knex.js & SQLite3.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm keen to collabarate on fullstack applications that can solve real-world problems and/or can create positive change. Outside of this, I would happily contribute to anything that can help me build my skills in the areas listed above! I'm excited to learn new languages and technologies so I can expand and grow as a developer.

- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with internships, grad and entry-level software development roles.
